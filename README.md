## Running Tests Locally

### Unit

```bash
npm run test
```

### End-to-end

The End-2-End tests require access to GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket accounts.
If you don't have access to accounts that can be used for testing, then you can't run them locally.

To set them up, make a file called `.jest.env` in the root of the project with the following:

```ini
GITHUB_USERNAME=<username>
GITHUB_PAT=<personal access token>

GITLAB_USERNAME=<username>
GITLAB_PAT=<personal access token>

BITBUCKET_USERNAME=<username>
BITBUCKET_PAT=<personal access token>
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
